## Game Design - 

## What makes a good game

Design is universal, not exclusive to Games but can be found in other discplines.
Fundamentals of games - from the classic Dice / Board games, how to bring it's core values to current games

Important to balance study and practise
continuous process of study, practice, assimilation, and synthesis that is going to last the rest of your life.

When people play games, they have an experience. It is this experience that the designer cares about. Without the experience, the game is worthless.
The game is not the experience. The game enables the experience, but it is not the experience. 

The point is that you don’t need to perfectly replicate real experiences to make a good game. What you need to do is to capture the essence of those experiences for your game. What does “the essence of an experience” really mean? Every memo- rable experience has some key features that define it and make it special.

As a game designer trying to design an experience, your goal is to figure out the essential elements that really define the experience you want to create, and find ways to make them part of your game design.

Lens #1: The Lens of Essential Experience
To use this lens, you stop thinking about your game and start thinking about the experience of the player. Ask yourself these questions:
● What experience do I want the player to have?
● What is essential to that experience?
● How can my game capture that essence?
If there is a big difference between the experience you want to create and the one you are actually creating, your game needs to change: You need to clearly state the essential experience you desire, and find as many ways as possible to instill this essence into your game.

Lens #2: The Lens of Surprise
Surprise is so basic that we can easily forget about it. Use this lens to remind yourself to fill your game with interesting surprises. Ask yourself these questions:
● What will surprise players when they play my game?
● Does the story in my game have surprises? Do the game rules? Does the artwork? The technology?
● Do your rules give players ways to surprise each other?
● Do your rules give players ways to surprise themselves?

Lens #3: The Lens of Fun
Fun is desirable in nearly every game, although sometimes fun defies analysis. To maximize your game’s fun, ask yourself these questions:
● What parts of my game are fun? Why?
● What parts need to be more fun?


Play is manipulation that indulges curiosity.
“It is an invariable principle of all play ... that whoever plays, plays freely. Whoever must play cannot play."

When you design for "Play" it is interesting to think about how you can change the activity of the game to be exciting for the user to be considered playing it. To me, the term "play" invokes a sense of innocence, freedom, curiousity and self enjoyment. It contrasts to "mandatory" because that is where is expected / forced work. Both Play and Mandatory can be enjoyable and even fun experiences but they are different triggers / approaches to an activity.

Lens #4: The Lens of Curiosity
To use this lens, think about the player’s true motivations — not just the goals your game has set forth, but the reason the player wants to achieve those goals. Ask yourself these questions:
● What questions does my game put into the player’s mind?
● What am I doing to make them care about these questions?
● What can I do to make them invent even more questions?
For example, a maze-finding videogame might have a time-limit goal such that at each level, players are trying to answer the question: “Can I find my way through this maze in 30 seconds?” A way to make them care more would be to play interesting animations when they solve each maze, so players might also ask the question: “I wonder what the next animation will be?”

Q1. Games are entered willfully. 
Q2. Games have goals.
Q3. Games have conflict.
Q4. Games have rules.
Q5. Games can be won and lost.
Q6. Games are interactive.
Q7. Games have challenge.
Q8. Games can create their own internal value.
Q9. Games engage players.
Q10. Games are closed, formal systems.

One of the first things we do is to state the problem we are trying to solve, that is, define a clear goal (Q2). Next, we frame the problem. We determine its bounda- ries and the nature of the problem space. We also determine what methods we are allowed to use to solve the problem; that is, we determine the rules of the problem (Q4). How we do this is kind of hard to describe. It is not a completely verbal proc- ess. It is almost as if our minds are equipped to set up an internal, minimized, sim- plified version of reality that only includes the necessary interrelationships needed to solve the problem. This is like a cleaner, smaller version of the real-world situa- tion, which we can more easily consider and manipulate, or interact with (Q6). In a sense, we are establishing a closed, formal system (Q10) with a goal. We then work to reach that goal, which is usually challenging (Q7), because it involves some kind of conflict (Q3). If we care about the problem, we quickly become engaged (Q9) in solving it. When we are occupied in doing so, we kind of forget about the real world, since we are focused on our internal problem space. Since this problem space is not the real world, and just a simplified version of it, and solving the problem is important to us, elements in the problem space quickly gain an internal importance, if they get us closer to our goal of solving the problem, and this importance does not need to be relevant outside the context of the problem (Q8). Eventually, we defeat the problem, or are defeated by it, thus winning or losing (Q5).

Games play games b/c = “I like solving problems.”

A game is a structured experience, both visually and with player input, where players must overcome challenges.

A game is a closed, formal system, that engages players in structured conflict, and resolves in an unequal outcome.

A game is a problem-solving activity, approached with a playful attitude.


Lens #5: The Lens of Endogenous Value
To use this lens, think about your players’ feelings about items, objects, and scoring in your game. Ask yourself these questions:
● What is valuable to the players in my game?
● How can I make it more valuable to them?
● What is the relationship between value in the game and the player’s motivations?

Lens #6: The Lens of Problem Solving
To use this lens, think about the problems your players must solve to suc- ceed at your game, for every game has problems to solve. Ask yourself these questions:
● What problems does my game ask the player to solve?
● Are there hidden problems to solve that arise as part of gameplay?
● How can my game generate new problems so that players keep coming back?
