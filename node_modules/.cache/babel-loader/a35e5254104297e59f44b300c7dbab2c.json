Average weight at preferred size is approximately 10.5 kg (23 lb) for males, 8 kg (18 lb) for females. Bones are moderate. The Shiba is double coated, with the outer coat being stiff and straight and the undercoat soft and thick. Fur is short and even on the fox-like face, ears, and legs. Guard hairs stand off the body and are about 4 to 5 cm (1 1\\u20442 to 2 in) long at the withers. The purpose of the guard hairs is to protect their underlying skin and to repel rain or snow.

Their tails help to protect them from the harsh winter weather. When they sleep, Shiba Inus curl up and use their tails to shield their face and nose in order to protect their sensitive areas from the cold.[citation needed] Shibas may be red, black and tan, or sesame (red with black-tipped hairs),[7] with a cream, buff, or grey undercoat.
