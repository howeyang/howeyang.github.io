Dota 2 that was taking the gaming community by storm, Dota\n                Autochess by Studio Drodo. The game mode itself was inspired by\n                older custom games: Pokemon TD from Warcraft3 and Casino TD from\n                Starcraft 2. When playing the game, I was inspired to create a\n                single-player spin on the game. Thus, I got to work to paper\n                prototyping and began to bring my vision to life in Unity.\n                <br /> <label>The Project Goal</label> <br />\n                My Project was to create a Minimal Viable Product that would\n                contain the core features : autonomous combat, unit placement\n                and combination. From there, add enough polish it to the point\n                where I could be proud of it.\n                <br /> <label>Summary</label> <br />I learned a lot from this\n                project: coding Combat AI and pathfinding, using Unity's Mecanim\n                Animation System, placing Environmental assets and all the small\n                things that contribute to polish.\n              </p>\n            </Fade>\n          </Grid>\n\n          <Grid item xs={12} sm={6} md={6} className=\"overlay2\">\n            <Fade>\n              <div className=\"black3\">\n                {\" \"}\n                Latest version <a>On haitus</a>\n              </div>\n            </Fade>\n            <Fade right>\n              <div className=\"section\">\n                <ReactPlayer\n                  url=\"autobattle.mp4\"\n                  width=\"100%\"\n                  height=\"100%\"\n                  controls={true}\n                  playing={true}\n                />\n              </div>\n            </Fade>\n          </Grid>\n\n          <Grid item xs={12} sm={6} md={6}>\n            <Fade>\n              <div className=\"black3\">Challenges and Components</div>\n            </Fade>\n            <Fade left>\n              <p className=\"section\">\n                <label>Building the board</label> <br />\n                The board / grid in which the player's units and enemy control\n                units fight on was a big challenge to tackle. I started with a\n                naive String Array implementation with the intention of storing\n                their placement but I quickly felt it's limitations.\n                <br /> To gain more functionality, I created a Node struct and\n                began to build a grid of Nodes. The Node data structure allowed\n                me to store data, hold references to their neighbours and able\n                to do simple heuristic pathing to other nodes via the A*\n                Algorithim.\n                <br />\n                <label>Creating AI and Autonomous combat</label> <br />\n                Creating the AI for the game meant building a modular script\n                that could run independantly in each game unit. Performance and\n                synchronous combat was a big concern for me. This lead me to\n                coding the AI script with no Update logic. Instead, all units\n                relied on the board script to invoke a Stepping function which\n                make it run through it's logic. The downside of this was\n                creating a tight coupling between the board and all units. The\n                upside of this was significantly reduced performance concerns\n                and allowed a sequential resolution of action and behaviours.\n              </p>\n            </Fade>\n          </Grid>\n\n          <Grid item xs={12} sm={6} md={6} className=\"overlay2\">\n            <Fade>\n              <div className=\"black3\">Development Snapshots</div>\n            </Fade>\n            <Fade right>\n              <AutoBattleCarousel />\n            </Fade>\n          </Grid>\n\n          <Grid item xs={12} sm={6} md={6}>\n            <Fade>\n              <div className=\"black3\">Lessons Learned</div>\n            </Fade>\n            <Fade left>\n              <p className=\"section\">\n                <label>Over Designing</label> <br />\n                I often kept going back to paper prototyping certain features /\n                concepts. Although this invigorated myself to keep working at\n                this project, very few of what I designed and thought of made it\n                into the prototype build. My lack of focus on and over designing\n                non-essential features wasted a lot of time and brain power.\n                <br /> <label>Too Tight Coupling</label> <br />\n                This sucked\n                <br /> <label>Monolithic or Tiny</label> <br />\n                Moderation or finding the right balance is something that I will\n                try to work towards.\n              </p>\n            </Fade>\n          </Grid>\n\n          <Grid item xs={12} sm={6} md={6} className=\"overlay2\">\n          <Fade>\n            <div className=\"black3\"> Future Considerations</div>\n            </Fade>\n            <Fade right>\n            <p className=\"section\">\n              This project was probably the most feature complete and playable\n              game I built since university.

Quick code prototyping definitely\n              helps to put something together but it is necessary to identify\n              what code should be generic, flexible and readable and re-write\n              the code.
