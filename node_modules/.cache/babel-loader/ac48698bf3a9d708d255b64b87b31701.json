When playing the game, I was inspired to create a\n                single-player spin on the game. Thus, I got to work to paper\n                prototyping and began to bring my vision to life in Unity.\n                <br /> <label>The Project Goal</label> <br />\n                My Project was to create a Minimal Viable Product that would\n                contain the core features : autonomous combat, unit placement\n                and combination. From there, add enough polish it to the point\n                where I could be proud of it.\n                <br /> <label>Summary</label> <br />I learned a lot from this\n                project: coding AI scripts, using Unity's Mecanim Animation\n                System, placing Environmental assets and all the small things\n                that contribute to polish.\n              </p>\n            </Fade>\n          </Grid>\n\n          {/* End of Grid Container*/}\n        </Grid>\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default AboutPage;\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
