                My introduction to websites was during my 3rd year at Waterloo in a UI design course. I learned about Gesalt principles, how to rudimentarily use HTML, Canvas and CSS to create a website. After graduating, I built a very sad website from scratch in HTML and Bootstrap CSS. After a year and while working at Upsight, I upgraded my website from a Bootstrap template website and began to customize it, adding in a Javascript animation and my own CSS to polish it up. <br></br>
                Over time, I learnt how to better utilize CSS into a
                website, how to build with responsive / mobile layout in mind
                and improve my understanding of website aesthetics.<br />
                <label>React</label> <br></br>
                In 2019, I was thinking about what my next step was going to
                be and I took a hard look at Web Development and UI design careers.
                The two Web development languages that caught my eye were Angular and React. <br></br>
                After trying both out, it was much easier to use React especially due to it's popularity, modularity and similarity to HTML.
