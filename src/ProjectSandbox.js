                This is a dedicated section to concepts and things I've been
                experimenting with in Unity. There are a ton of cool effects and
                concepts in games and media. On occasion, I challenge myself to
                research and re-create the math and logic that can duplicate
                some of these effects.

                The PS4 home screen is a beautiful yet simple wave with softly
                emitting particles. I wanted to challenge myself to re-create it in Unity.
                <br />
                <label>Challenge and Solution</label> <br />
                The major challenge is an issue with aliasing artifacts. Even
                when bumping the number vertices of the plane I was using to
                40,000 tries and decreasing the amount of deviation between
                points, aliasing was still apparent. As a solution, I decided
                that it might not be possible to have beautiful with a 2D plane
                by itself. With a texture with transparent edges, it is possible
                to almost eliminate aliasing significantly.

                After watching the Youtube Tutorials by Dan Moran, "Making Stuff look good in Unity", I tried my hand at making building shaders via scripting and Unity's Node Shader.
                <br />
                <label>Considerations</label> <br />
                Shaders and graphic effects are something that I want to understand and utilize.
                There is definitely a steep learning curve and even after taking one of the best ( and hardest ) 4th year Graphics course at Waterloo, it's still magic to me.
                Hopefully down the line, I'll be able to put some time in to create better SFX.

                <label>Summary</label> <br />
                One of the most powerful and flexible systems in Unity is the Particle system.
                I have leveraged it to add some flair and polish for impact and as a visual effect.
                <br />
                <label>Challenges</label> <br />
                There is a slight learning curve to the Particle system, understanding how to use new texture, material and turn all the knobs in the System to get a new effect.
                Once you have that down though, the limit is your imagination and effort in making a cool effect!
