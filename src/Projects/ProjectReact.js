                <label>HTML and CSS beginnings</label> <br />
                My introduction to website development was during my 3rd year at
                Waterloo in a UI design course. I learned about the basic DOM
                structure, Gesalt principles, how to use HTML, Canvas and CSS to
                create a website. After graduating, I built a very sad website
                from scratch in HTML and Bootstrap CSS. After a year and while
                working at Upsight, I upgraded my website from a Bootstrap
                template website and began to customize it, adding in a
                Javascript animation and my own CSS to polish it up. <br />
                Over time, I learnt how to better utilize CSS into a website,
                how to build with responsive / mobile layout in mind and improve
                my understanding of website aesthetics.

                <label>React</label> <br />
                In 2019, I was thinking about what my next step was going to be
                and I took a look at possible Web Development and UI design
                careers. I decided to pick up React as it seemed like the most
                HTML like, had an interesting component behaviour and a lot of
                active support. I created my first application based off some
                Basketball Stats API. It wasn't too bad and I experimented
                deploying to cloud hosting like Heroku and Firebase. You can

                <label>Current</label> <br />I have matured a lot as a developer
                and have become more familiar with web development. Now when I
                design a website, I plan ahead for responsive design and layout,
                performance and consistent colouring theme. I try to leverage
                white space, simplify navigation and include transitions to make
                the user experience as enjoyable as possible.
