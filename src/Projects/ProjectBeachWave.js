                <label>Water Shader</label> <br />
                This Unity Project was a study on how to use Shaders to create
                stylized water. My water shader uses a mix of trigonometry to
                create the curvature, noise texture and thresholds to create
                this stylized effect.
                <br></br>
                <label>Part 1 : My own approach </label> <br />
                Initially, I decided to see if I could do my own reverse
                engineering to figure out what is necessary to make a Water
                Shader :
                <ul className="list">
                  <li>
                    ● Deform a plane to give the impression of water ebb and
                    flow
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    ● Using a Noise Texture and Thresholds to create White Foam
                    effects
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    ● Using Camera Depth and layering Color Gradients to create
                    the blue colour
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <label>Part 2 : Research and Layering Effects</label> <br />
                At this point, my shader was decent but still had room for
                improvement! Via Simon Schreibt's talk on how his team created
                stylized water in Rime, I added on the following features :
                <ul className="list">
                  <li>
                    ● Adding motion to Foam texture and switch to a line texture
                  </li>
                  <li>● Adding Caustic and illumation lines to the water</li>
                  <li>● Adding fake reflections to the water</li>
                </ul>

                While browsing /r/Unity3D, there was a video of a wave lightly
                crashing with a beach by /u/neural-bot who used Shader Graph.
                This video itself was inspired by a picture by Owen Pomery,
                'Quick Water Study'.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                There was a simple beauty there, an isolation of stylized water
                and foam, with a gentle motion ebb and flow giving it a natural
                feeling and beautiful aesthetic. From this video and from my
                previous experience in Unity, I challenged myself to reproduce
                the effect!
                <br />
                <label>Beginnings</label> <br />
                My previous tinkering with making waves has helped me understand
                the best way to create water effects in Unity is via{" "}
                <span>Shaders</span>. Scripting a plane's mesh and modifying
                material properties leaves too many artifacts and doesn't result
                in a convincing wave. <br></br>I began my scene with a Probuild
                Cube modified to look like a ramp and a horizontal plane
                intersecting into it. From there, I set a sand like material for
                the ramp and began writing a custom Shader for the plane which
                would represent my water.

                To reverse engineer and implement this ideal stylized water
                effect to life, I broke it down to a series of components that I
                needed to create.
                <ul className="list">
                  <li>1. Distorting the Plane mesh to Curve like a wave.</li>
                  <li>2. Making the Plane mesh ebb and flow like a wave.</li>
                  <li>
                    3. Colouring the wave based on depth difference between
                    plane and ramp.
                  </li>
                  <li>4. Adding a hard white line at rim of plane.</li>
                  <li>5. Adding foam effects that ebb and flow with Noise.</li>
                  <li>6. Polish and Iterate on everything!</li>
