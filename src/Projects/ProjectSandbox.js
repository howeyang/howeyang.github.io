                This is a dedicated section to concepts and things I've been
                experimenting with in Unity in 2018. There are a ton of cool effects and
                concepts in games and media. On occasion, I challenge myself to
                research and re-create the math and logic that can duplicate
                some of these effects.

                  One of the most powerful and flexible systems in Unity is the
                  Particle system. I have leveraged it to add some flair and
                  polish for impact and as a visual effect.
                  <br />
                  <label>Challenges</label> <br />
                  There is a slight learning curve to the Particle system,
                  understanding how to use new texture, material and turn all
                  the knobs in the System to get a new effect. Once you have
                  that down though, the limit is your imagination and effort in
                  making a cool effect!

                  The PS4 home screen is a beautiful yet simple wave with softly
                  emitting particles. I wanted to challenge myself to re-create
                  it in Unity.
                  <br />
                  <label>Challenge and Solution</label> <br />
                  The major challenge is an issue with aliasing artifacts. Even
                  when bumping the number vertices of the plane I was using to
                  40,000 tries and decreasing the amount of deviation between
                  points, aliasing was still apparent. As a solution, I decided
                  that it might not be possible to have beautiful with a 2D
                  plane by itself. With a texture with transparent edges, it is
                  possible to almost eliminate aliasing significantly.
                  <br></br>
                  Later on, when I started working with Shaders, I realized that
                  the best way to deform vertices in with the vertex shader as
                  it's high performance and minimal aliasing.

                  <label>Summary</label> <br />
                  After watching the Youtube Tutorials by Dan Moran, "Making
                  Stuff look good in Unity", I tried my hand at making building
                  shaders via scripting and Unity's Node Shader.
                  <br />
                  <label>Considerations</label> <br />
                  Shaders and graphic effects are something that I want to
                  understand and utilize. There is definitely a steep learning
                  curve and even after taking one of the best ( and hardest )
                  4th year Graphics course at Waterloo, it's still magic to me.
                  <br></br>
                  This was my inital approach to Shaders and I have since moved
                  onto projects based on making a specific shader that meets my
                  own expectations. Feel free to check it out :{" "}
