## Planning 
This is basically going to be a updated version of my Website!
Previous website was OK and all but was built purely in HTML and CSS with some minor JS

This new website is going to be a Single Page Application built with React and React components.
Will have a combination of my Gallery and Dev work / learnings

## TO DO

Update GIFs to MP4 ( better compression ) 
Create new visuals and stuff in Unity to bring to React

## Landing page

UI BAR : Home - Projects - About Me - Contact

Splash with my latest game video in the background

tiles / cards at the bottom showcasing some works as well ( static images )
Tell them to check out Projects for more show casing and information

Footer - From the North : Toronto, Ontario

## Projects
