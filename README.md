## React Website

The goal for this website is to create a Single Application Page in React and hosted on my Github User page.
You should be able to access this at [https://howeyang.github.io](https://howeyang.github.io).
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and began around July 2019.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, to locally host the React application, I can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run deploy`

Based on my current package.json configuration, this will push to the master branch of the userpage.
This allows me to properly deploy and host my homepage on github.
